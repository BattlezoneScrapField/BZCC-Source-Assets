## Introduction
This licence agreement (‚ÄúMod Licence‚Äù) is a contract between you, the person using the Source (as defined below) and Rebellion Interactive Limited (‚ÄúRebellion‚Äù). Your installation or use of the Source indicates your acceptance of the terms of this Mod Licence.

The ‚ÄúSource‚Äù consists of the art assets relating to Battlezone: Combat Commander (the ‚ÄúGame‚Äù) which are explicitly provided for download at mods.battlezone.com for the purpose of modding the Game.

BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING OR USING THE SOURCE, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS MOD LICENCE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS MOD LICENCE, PLEASE DO NOT DOWNLOAD, INSTALL OR USE THE SOURCE.

## License
Provided you have a valid licence to use the Game, Rebellion hereby grants you a limited, non exclusive, non transferable licence to download and install the Source on your home computer and to use the Source to create and share new downloadable user generated content for the Game (and which require a functioning copy of the Game) (‚ÄúGame Mods‚Äù), including without limitation customised content that modifies the experience of the Game. The term ‚ÄúGame Mods‚Äù includes elements of the Game not limited to buildings, vehicles, characters, terrain, maps and audio. You are only permitted to distribute the Game Mods to individual end users that own authorised copies of the Game (which means copies of the Game which have a valid licence). You can distribute Game Mods through lawful distribution channels but must specify that Game Mods are only provided for authorised copies of the Game.

All uses of the Source are for your personal, non-commercial use and for use only, solely within the Game, and in each case subject to the terms and conditions of this Mod Licence.

You are solely responsible for the Game Mods that you have created and are liable for Game Mods that you make available to third parties.

You are responsible for all costs and expenses associated with acquiring any hardware, software that allows you to create Game Mods and for acquiring all necessary licences or permissions you may require for any Game Mod.

If you distribute a Game Mod you must clearly state that it is an unofficial Game Mod and is not endorsed or supported by Rebellion and you must not make any claim to any intellectual property right which belongs to Rebellion, including any intellectual property right in or relating to the Game.

This Mod Licence does not include a permission to distribute the Game itself.

## Ownership
The Source is licensed, not sold, and no rights, title or ownership in the Source (or any part of it) are transferred to you. All intellectual property rights in or relating to the Source are the sole property of Rebellion.

## Limitations on Use
You agree that you shall not: (a) exploit any part of the Source commercially or in return for any valuable consideration; (b) sell, lease, rent, license, distribute or otherwise transfer the Source in return for anything of value; or (c) circumvent or disable or remove any copyright or trade mark notices. Game Mods should operate in conjunction with the Game but not with any other video game or other software. All Game Mods must comply with any additional rules set by distribution channels (for instance Steam Workshop rules).

You will not permit any third party to distribute or use Game Mods developed or created by you for any commercial purpose.

The prohibitions in this Mod Licence against commercial use or purpose do not prevent you from monetizing videos or streams showing gameplay, but please just ensure that you follow the rules set by the platform you use (e.g. YouTube and Twitch).

## Warranty
Rebellion warrants that for 90 days after the Source was first made available to end users, and provided that the Source was installed and used on a PC with the appropriate configuration, the Source will function substantially in accordance with the specifications published by Rebellion.

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, REBELLION DISCLAIMS ALL OTHER WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT IN RESPECT OF THE SOURCE.

If you develop or distribute any Game Mods, then you warrant that you own or have sufficient legal rights in all elements of those Game Mods. This includes, without limitation, copyrights, trademark rights, and any other kind of intellectual property rights included in any Game Mod.

Furthermore, you warrant that any such Game Mod does not contain any content that is libellous, defamatory, harmful, threatening or contain other illegal or scandalous content or material, or which contravenes any applicable law or regulation, or which infringes the rights of any person. Game Mods must not contain any virus, trojan horse, malware, spyware or hidden content.

## Limitation of Liability
IN NO EVENT SHALL REBELLION BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT OR CONSEQUENTIAL LOSS OR DAMAGE OR ANY ECONOMIC LOSS UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS LICENCE OR IN ANY OTHER MANNER IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOURCE.

THE ENTIRE LIABILITY OF REBELLION UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS LICENCE OR IN ANY OTHER MANNER IN CONNECTION WITH THE GAME SHALL BE LIMITED TO AN OBLIGATION PROVIDE A REPLACEMENT COPY OF THE SOURCE.

However, nothing in this Mod Licence shall limit the liability of Rebellion for fraudulent misrepresentation, personal injury caused by Rebellion‚Äôs negligence, or any other form of liability which cannot be limited or excluded by contract.

## Termination and Modification
This Mod Licence starts at the time you accept this EULA and it will remain effective until terminated. You may terminate this Mod Licence at any time by (i) permanently destroying all copies of the Source in your possession or control and (ii) removing the Source from your storage device. This Mod Licence shall automatically terminate if you violate or breach any term or condition in this EULA. Rebellion may also terminate this Mod Licence at any time for any reason or no reason and you must immediately do (i) and (ii) above upon receiving notice of termination. This Mod Licence operates in addition to the Game EULA and any other licence agreement applicable to your use of the Game.

Rebellion can change the Source and change the rules relating to use of the Source at any time. Rebellion can amend this Mod Licence at any time, and any amendment will be binding once the new terms have been published.

## Jurisdiction
This Mod Licence shall be construed according to English law and the English courts have exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute concerning the Source or this Mod Licence. No terms of this Mod Licence are enforceable by a third party pursuant to the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999. Rebellion can assign the benefit of this Mod Licence to any person.
